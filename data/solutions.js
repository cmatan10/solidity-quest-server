  6: `1. **Base Gas Consumption (Overhead)**: When the \`complexOperation\` function is called with the argument \`0\`, it consumes a certain amount of gas, let's call it \`x\` units. 
          This \`x\` represents the base gas cost for executing the function without entering the loop. 
   It's includes the cost of reading and writing to storage, and other computational overheads.

2. **Gas Consumption for a Single Iteration**: When you invoke the function with an argument of \`1\`, it results in a gas consumption of \`y\` units. 
          This includes the base gas cost \`x\` plus the gas cost of one iteration of the loop.

Using the above data:
\`\`\`
Gas Per Iteration = y - x = z units
\`\`\`

Average Gas Consumption = (3000 + 5000) / 2 = 4000 units
\`\`\`

Applying this to our function's gas consumption pattern:
\`\`\`
x + z*n = 4000
=> z*n = 4000 - x
=> n â‰ˆ (4000 - x) / z
\`\`\`

Thus, it is deduced that about \`n\` iterations are requisite to approach an average gas consumption of 4000 units.

- Enter the number \`n\` in the \`iterations\` input box.

- Click the \`complexOperation\` button and confirm the transaction.`,

  7: `- Copy the smart contract address, which is under the heading \`Your Test Address\`.

- Open the code editor you use and create an \`index.js\` file with the following code:

\`\`\`javascript
const Web3 = require('web3');
const https = '< your-rpc-provider >';
const web3 = new Web3(https);
web3.eth.getStorageAt("< contract-address >", 0, console.log);
\`\`\`

- Replace \`<contract-address>\` with the smart contract address you copied.

- Run the script and copy the hexadecimal number from the received output.

- Enter the hexadecimal number in the input box \`_password\`.

- Enter any number in the \`newPassword\` input box.

- Click the \`changePassword\` button and confirm the transaction.`,

  8: `\`type(uint256).max\` = Max

\`(counter = Max - 3)[---------(counter + 3 = Max)---(counter + 4 = 0)---------](counter + 7 = 3)\`

When the \`counter\` starts at \`Max - 3\`, the overflow logic is:

1. When \`3\` uints are added to the counter, it reaches \`Max\`.
2. Adding to the starting value \`4\` causes an overflow, resetting the counter to \`0\`.
3. If \`7\` is added to the starting value, the counter wraps around and becomes \`3\`.

- Enter the number \`7\` in the \`value\` input box.

- Click the \`add\` button and confirm the transaction.`,

  9: `- Click the hint button, copy the hash that represents the newly deployed contract, and paste it into the search box on the block explorer.
